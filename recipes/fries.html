    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 2 ½ pounds russet potatoes, peeled</li>
        <li> 1 cup vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li> 1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon onion salt</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li> ½ cup water, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Gather all ingredients. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
        </li>

        <li>
            Slice potatoes into French fries and place them into a large bowl of cold water to prevent them from turning brown.
         </li>

        <li>
            While the oil is heating, sift flour, garlic salt, onion salt, paprika, and salt into a large bowl. Gradually stir in enough water to make a slightly thick batter that can be drizzled from a spoon.
        </li>

        <li>
            Drain fries and pat dry; dip into the batter one at a time.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            Lower fries carefully into the hot oil in batches to prevent them from clumping together. Fry until golden brown and crispy on all sides, about 7 to 10 minutes.
        </li>

        <li>
            Drain fries on a paper towel-lined plate.
        </li>

        <li>
            Serve hot and enjoy!
